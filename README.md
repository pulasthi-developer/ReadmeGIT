## Demo

## Introduction
This project aims to track and display the real-time locations of trains across the country. The system's primary component is GPS-enabled IoT devices, which provide live location data. The project plans to install these IoT devices in each train engine to capture data at 1-minute intervals. The captured GPS data is transmitted to a central server for storage via a RESTful web API. The Client application (SPA) displays the real-time train location using that stored data.
